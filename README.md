# Binary Triangle Pattern in C

This C program prints a triangle pattern using alternating binary digits (`0` and `1`). Each row contains repeated `01` based on its row number.

## 💻 Language

C

## 📋 Description

- Uses nested `for` loops:
  - Outer loop for rows (`i`)
  - Inner loop prints `"01"` multiple times per row
- Output forms a triangle shape of binary digits

## 🧪 Sample Output

01

0101

010101

01010101

0101010101

010101010101

## 🛠️ How to Run

```bash
gcc binary_pattern.c -o pattern
./pattern
